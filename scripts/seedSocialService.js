  description: `Exceptional catering services for birthdays, anniversaries, holiday parties, and all social gatherings in Cleveland, Ohio.

Excellent food and a beautiful setting are important, but quality service truly sets the guest experience apart. Besides special in-depth training, providing exceptional service comes down to the staff-to-guest ratio. These numbers determine important event factors, such as how quickly food is served, the length of bar lines and the efficiency of passing hors d'oeuvres.

Marigold is committed to providing excellent service along with our food and event planning. Our goal is to let you relax and enjoy your own event, hardly knowing a well-oiled service machine is operating in the background!

Together, our team provides multiple layers of quality control and cohesion in order to elevate and conduct your event effortlessly.`,
